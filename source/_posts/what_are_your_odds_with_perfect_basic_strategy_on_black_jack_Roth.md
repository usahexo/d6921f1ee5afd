# What are Your Odds with Perfect Basic Strategy on Blackjack: Insights from Roth

Alvin E. Roth is an American economist who was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2012. Although he is not a professional blackjack player, his insights can provide valuable information on the odds of winning at blackjack with perfect basic strategy. In this article, we will explore the question of what your odds are with perfect basic strategy on blackjack, as explained by Roth.

## Understanding Basic Strategy

Basic strategy is a set of guidelines that players can follow to make the most optimal decisions in every situation in blackjack. The strategy is based on the player's hand, the dealer's up card, and the number of decks being used in the game. By following basic strategy, players can reduce the house edge and improve their odds of winning in the long run.

## Odds of Winning with Basic Strategy

According to Roth, the odds of winning at blackjack with perfect basic strategy depend on several factors, including the rules of the game and the number of decks being used. However, in general, the house edge in blackjack with perfect basic strategy is typically around 0.5% or lower.

This means that for every $100 bet, a player can expect to lose around 50 cents on average. Of course, the actual results will vary from session to session and there is always a risk of losing money in any gambling game.

## Importance of Basic Strategy

Following basic strategy is crucial for players who want to improve their odds of winning at blackjack. By making the most optimal decisions in every situation, players can reduce the house edge and increase their chances of winning in the long run.

It is important to note that while basic strategy can improve your odds of winning, it does not guarantee a win in every session. Blackjack is still a game of chance, and there will be times when you will lose money even when playing with perfect basic strategy.

## Conclusion

Understanding the odds of winning at blackjack with perfect basic strategy is an important part of playing the game effectively. By following insights from Roth, players can recognize that the house edge in blackjack with perfect basic strategy is typically around 0.5% or lower. With this knowledge, players can take their blackjack skills to the next level and become more successful and knowledgeable players.
