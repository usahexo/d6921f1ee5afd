#  Bible Says Playing Is A Sin

There are many people who believe that playing is a sin, and the Bible seems to support this belief. The first instance of this comes from when God tells Adam and Eve not to eat from the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil. God says "And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die." (Genesis 2:16-17)

Later on in the Bible, there are more references to playing being a sin. In 1 Timothy 5:13, Paul says "Young widows study to be quiet, to mind their own business, to work with their hands, that they may not be idle." This could be interpreted as meaning that playing is wasting time and not contributing anything useful.

In 2 Thessalonians 3:10-12, Paul writes "For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat. For we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly, working not at all, but are busybodies. Now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ," which could be read as meaning that those who do not work should not play either.

So based on these verses from the Bible, it does appear that playing is considered a sin by some people. However, it is important to remember that just because something is mentioned in the Bible doesn't mean it is automatically true, and each person should come to their own conclusions about what is right and wrong.

#  Why Playing Is Important According To The Bible

There are many benefits that come along with playing. Numerous studies have found that play can help improve academic achievement, creativity, self-esteem and social skills. While these benefits are important, it is crucial to realize that they pale in comparison to the eternal benefits that come from playing according to God’s design.

One of the primary purposes of play is to develop our God-given abilities. Genesis 1:27 says “So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.” We were created as playful beings, and when we play we are fulfilling our purpose on earth.

In Proverbs 17:22, we read “A cheerful heart is good medicine, but a crushed spirit dries up the bones.” When we are happy and playful, it radiates outwards and impacts those around us. This positive energy can be contagious and help revive a crushed spirit.

Play is also a key way for us to connect with others on a deeper level. In Proverbs 18:24, we read “A man who has friends must show himself friendly, and there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother.” Play allows us to build close relationships with others as we share in common experiences and memories. These relationships can be a source of support during difficult times.

 Ultimately, playing is an important part of who we are as Christians. It brings joy into our lives and allows us to connect with others in meaningful ways. When we recognize the importance of playing according to God’s design, we can enjoy these benefits while also preparing ourselves for eternity.
