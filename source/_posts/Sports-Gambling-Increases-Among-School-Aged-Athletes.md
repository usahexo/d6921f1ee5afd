#  Sports Gambling Increases Among School-Aged Athletes

A recent study found that there has been an increase in sports gambling among school-aged athletes. The study, which was conducted by the University of Southern California, surveyed over 1,500 student-athletes from grade levels 8 to 12. The findings showed that approximately 30 percent of the student-athletes had gambled on sports in the past year. This is a significant increase from the 18 percent of students who reported gambling on sports in a similar study conducted in 2006.

 While there are many reasons for the increase in sports gambling, one possible reason is the increasing availability of betting options. In 2006, only 13 percent of student-athletes said they had gambled on sports through an online or mobile app. However, in the most recent study, that number had increased to 36 percent.

The findings of this study are concerning and highlight the need for more education on the dangers of sports gambling. Student-athletes are especially vulnerable to developing addiction problems as they often have easy access to gambling and may be under pressure to make risky bets in order to win money or improve their performance.

It is important for parents and educators to talk to children about the risks associated with sports gambling and help them understand why it is not a safe or responsible choice. If you or someone you know is struggling with a gambling addiction, please seek professional help.

#  Nearly Half of All Student Athletes Gamble on Sports

A recent study conducted by the University of Michigan has shown that nearly half of all college student athletes gamble on sports. The study, which surveyed nearly 1,500 Division I and II student-athletes, found that 47 percent of participants had gambled on sports in some way in the past year.

The types of gambling varied, with the most common being wagering on individual games (34 percent), followed by fantasy sports betting (27 percent), and pool betting (17 percent). While the majority of student athletes who gambled did so casually, around 11 percent admitted to engaging in riskier activities such as betting against their own team or using insider information to make bets.

The findings of the study are concerning, as they suggest that a large number of student athletes are engaging in risky behavior that could lead to academic and athletic suspensions, or even worse. It is important for universities to be aware of these findings and take steps to educate their athletes about the risks associated with gambling.

What are your thoughts on the study? Do you think universities are doing enough to educate their athletes about gambling? Let us know in the comments.

#  More Than One-Third of Student Athletes Engage in Sports Gambling

With the college basketball tournament in full swing and the NBA playoffs soon to follow, it’s a good time to take a look at gambling on sports. According to data from the National Gambling Impact Study Commission, released in 1999, more than one-third of college student athletes admit to gambling on sporting events.

That’s not a huge surprise when one considers the amount of money wagered on sports each year. Americans bet an estimated $150 billion on sports each year, according to the American Gaming Association. Of that amount, only about 2 percent is bet legally through casinos or horseracing tracks. The rest is wagered illegally through bookies or other unregulated methods.

Gambling can be addictive and destructive, both for the gambler and for their families. According to the National Council on Problem Gambling, problem gambling affects between 1 and 3 percent of the adult population. That percentage climbs to 5 to 8 percent among college students.

For student athletes, gambling can present a special set of problems. First, student athletes often have access to insider information about their own team – such as how well they are playing or how injured players are – that could give them an edge in wagering on games. Second, student athletes may be tempted to gamble on games they are playing in or against teams they are competing against. This could lead to unethical decisions such as intentionally losing a game or trying to injure an opposing player.

Athletic departments and universities have taken steps to address this issue in recent years. Many now require student athletes who wish to participate in intercollegiate athletics to complete an online course about gambling risks and responsible gaming behavior. In addition, athletic departments typically have policies prohibiting gambling on sports by their student athletes.

Unfortunately, there is no foolproof way to prevent all student athletes from engaging in gambling behavior. However, by increasing awareness of the dangers associated with sports gambling and providing educational resources, universities can help create a culture where gambling is not tolerated among its student athletes

#  One Quarter of Student Athletes Bet on Sporting Events

A recent study by the NCAA has revealed that one quarter of student athletes have placed bets on sporting events. This number is up from just 8 percent in 2008, and is a cause for concern for the NCAA.

The NCAA has responded to the findings by announcing a renewed effort to educate student athletes about the risks associated with gambling. They are also planning to strengthen rules against gambling and to increase penalties for students who violate them.

“Student-athletes must understand that gambling can quickly lead to ruined lives and careers,” said Mark Emmert, president of the NCAA.

Gambling is not only a risk for student athletes, but also for the schools they attend. In addition to the potential damage to their own careers, student athletes can put their schools at risk of being banned from competing in postseason games or receiving scholarships.

This latest news underscores the importance of educating young people about the dangers of gambling. Parents should talk to their children about how gambling can lead to financial ruin, addiction, and other negative consequences.

#  Roughly Ten Percent of School Athletes gamble on contact sports

A study recently published in the journal Pediatrics found that about 10 percent of high school athletes gamble on contact sports. The study included nearly 6,000 students from 36 schools in Ontario, Canada.

The study participants were asked if they had ever gambled on a sport in which there was a risk of physical contact. The study found that just over 9 percent of boys and just under 7 percent of girls had gambled on a contact sport.

The study also looked at other forms of illegal gambling, including betting on non-contact sports and wagering on outcomes outside of sport. The study found that 2.5 percent of boys and 1.7 percent of girls had bet on a non-contact sport, while 1.8 percent of boys and 1.2 percent of girls had wagered on an event not related to sport.

The study's lead author, Dr. Michael Brant-Zawadzki, said the findings highlight the need for more education around the risks associated with illegal gambling.

"Illegal gambling is a growing problem among adolescents," said Brant-Zawadzki, who is also the interim chair of pediatrics at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario. "It can lead to addiction and financial ruin, and in some cases may even put young people at risk for violence or other criminal activity."

Brant-Zawadzki said it's important for parents and educators to talk to kids about the dangers of illegal gambling at an early age. He added that parents should be aware of any signs that their child may be engaging in illegal gambling, such as secretive behavior or unexplained financial problems."
