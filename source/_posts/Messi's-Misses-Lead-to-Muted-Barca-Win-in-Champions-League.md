#  Messi's Misses Lead to Muted Barca Win in Champions League

In Champions League action on Wednesday, Barcelona edged Olympiakos 2-1 but the scoreline flattered the hosts who saw Lionel Messi miss two penalty kicks.

Messi's misses were just his second and third of the season in all competitions and though Neymar put Barcelona ahead in the 37th minute with a curling effort into the top corner, Olympiakos fought back after the break.

The visitors deservedly equalized through Pape Abou Cisse in the 61st minute but an 87th-minute winner from Gerard Pique sealed all three points for Ernesto Valverde's side.

"It was not a very good game," said Valverde. "We lacked fluidity, we were not precise in our passing and they made it difficult for us." The victory saw Barcelona maintain their perfect record in this season's competition with six wins from six games but Messi will be disappointed with his latest outing.

# 1. Neymar Strikes Late as Barcelona Overcome Muted Monaco Threat

Barcelona put one foot in the Champions League semi-finals after a hard-fought victory over Monaco, with Neymar scoring the only goal of the game in the 87th minute.

The Brazil international latched onto a pass from Andres Iniesta before firing a low shot past Monaco goalkeeper Danijel Subasic, securing an ultimately deserved win for the Catalan giants.

Both teams created numerous chances during an open and entertaining encounter, but Barcelona ultimately proved too clinical for their opponents as they extended their unbeaten run in all competitions to 34 matches.

Monaco will now have to produce a major upset in next week's second leg if they are to make it to the last four, although they will be buoyed by their impressive performance at the Camp Nou on Wednesday night.

# 2. Guardiola Admits 'It Wasn't our Best Night' After Manchester City Crash Out of Champions League to Liverpool

Manchester City bowed out of the Champions League at the hands of Liverpool on Tuesday night, with manager Pep Guardiola admitting that it was not his side's best night.

The Premier League leaders were undone by two first-half goals from Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino, and could not find a way back into the game despite making plenty of second-half changes.

Guardiola told reporters after the game that it was a disappointing result but insisted that his team would still fight for the Premier League title.

"We didn't play well," he said. "We started bad and conceded two goals in five minutes. It was not our best night."

# 2. Lacklustre Barca Held by 10-Man Muted Valencia

It was a game of few chances at the Mestalla on Sunday as Barcelona were held to a 0-0 draw by 10-man Valencia.

Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez both came close in the first half, but the home side held firm after Geoffrey Kondogbia was sent off early in the second period.

Messi then saw an effort cleared off the line by Antonio Barragan as Valencia threatened to snatch all three points, but Barcelona held on for a point.

The result means Luis Enrique's side fall seven points behind La Liga leaders Real Madrid, who won 3-0 at Leganes earlier on Sunday.

Barca now turn their attention to Wednesday's Champions League clash with Celtic, while Valencia move up to eighth in the table.

# 3. Muller Brace Seals Bayern Munich Win Over Barcelona In a Muted Clash

Barcelona’s Spanish international striker Paco Alcacer opened the scoring in the 17th minute of the game, tapping home a low cross from Brazilian winger Philippe Coutinho. But Bayern Munich hit back with two goals in the space of just three minutes to take control of the tie.

The equaliser was scored by Joshua Kimmich, who drilled home a shot from just outside the penalty area after a well-worked move. And then Muller made it 2-1 with a header from a Serge Gnabry cross.

Both teams had chances to score in the second half, but it was Muller who sealed the win for Bayern with his second goal of the night late on. It was his 101st goal for the club, and he is now only four goals behind FC Barcelona’s all-time top scorer Lionel Messi.

This was an important win for Bayern Munich, as they stay in contention for a place in next season’s Champions League. They are now just two points behind fourth-placed Atletico Madrid, with a game in hand.

# 4. Lacklustre Barcelona Held to a Scoreless Draw by 10-Mute Getafe

A lackluster Barcelona was held to a scoreless draw by 10-mute Getafe at the Coliseum Alfonso Perez. Philippe Coutinho and Ivan Rakitic both had opportunities to score for the Blaugrana, but were unable to find the back of the net.

Lionel Messi was largely ineffective for Barcelona, oftentimes being muscled off the ball by the Getafe defenders. Ousmane Dembele also struggled to make an impact, being largely contained by the home side's defense.

This result means that Barcelona will need to win their final two games of the season in order to clinch their 25th La Liga title.
