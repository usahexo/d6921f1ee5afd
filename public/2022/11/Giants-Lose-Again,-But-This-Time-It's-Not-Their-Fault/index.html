        <h1 id="Giants-Lose-Again-But-This-Time-It’s-Not-Their-Fault"><a href="#Giants-Lose-Again-But-This-Time-It’s-Not-Their-Fault" class="headerlink" title="Giants Lose Again, But This Time It’s Not Their Fault"></a>Giants Lose Again, But This Time It’s Not Their Fault</h1><p>The Giants have now lost six consecutive games, but this time it’s not their fault.</p>
<p>Yes, the bullpen blew another lead and the offense couldn’t get anything going, but this time the Giants were actually playing pretty well. The Cardinals just happened to be even better.</p>
<p>“We’re in a funk right now,” Buster Posey said after the game. “But we’ll come out of it.”</p>
<p>The Giants have been in this position before. They’ve had prolonged losing streaks in each of the last two seasons. And they’ve bounced back both times.</p>
<p>There’s no reason to believe they can’t do it again. This is a talented team with a lot of character. They’ll find a way to turn things around.</p>
<h1 id="Manning-Leads-Team-to-Impressive-Victory-Over-Rams"><a href="#Manning-Leads-Team-to-Impressive-Victory-Over-Rams" class="headerlink" title="Manning Leads Team to Impressive Victory Over Rams"></a>Manning Leads Team to Impressive Victory Over Rams</h1><p>In a stunning display of offensive firepower, the Mannings led the team to an impressive victory over the Rams. With Peyton throwing for 410 yards and 3 touchdowns, and Eli adding another touchdown through the air, as well as one on the ground, this was a game that will be remembered for a long time.</p>
<p>The Rams defense had no answer for the Mannings, and the only touchdown they scored came very late in the game, when it was already too late. This was a dominating performance by the Manning brothers and their team, and it is sure to give them a lot of confidence as they head into the playoffs.</p>
<h1 id="Giants-Struggle-to-Start-Season-but-Remain-Confident"><a href="#Giants-Struggle-to-Start-Season-but-Remain-Confident" class="headerlink" title="Giants Struggle to Start Season but Remain Confident"></a>Giants Struggle to Start Season but Remain Confident</h1><p>The New York Giants had a tough start to their season with two losses in their first three games. However, they remain confident that they can turn their season around.</p>
<p>In their first game of the season, the Giants lost to the Dallas Cowboys, 20-13. They followed that up by losing to the Detroit Lions, 24-10. In their most recent game, they lost to the Philadelphia Eagles, 34-13.</p>
<p>Despite these early losses, the Giants remain confident that they can turn their season around. “We’re not happy with where we are, but we know we have the ability to get things turned around,” said quarterback Eli Manning. “We just need to execute better and play together as a team.”</p>
<p>The Giants are still relatively healthy, with only one player currently on injured reserve. And they have plenty of talent on their roster, including Manning, wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr., and defensive end Olivier Vernon.</p>
<p>So while the Giants have had a rough start to the season, they remain optimistic that they can turn things around. And if they do, they could still make a playoff run.</p>
<h1 id="Beckham-and-Cruz-Lead-Giants-to-Victory-in-Thrilling-Game"><a href="#Beckham-and-Cruz-Lead-Giants-to-Victory-in-Thrilling-Game" class="headerlink" title="Beckham and Cruz Lead Giants to Victory in Thrilling Game"></a>Beckham and Cruz Lead Giants to Victory in Thrilling Game</h1><p>It was a close game, but the New York Giants managed to pull out a victory against the Philadelphia Eagles with a final score of 27-24. The star players for the Giants were quarterback Eli Manning and receiver Odell Beckham Jr., who both had impressive performances.</p>
<p>Cruz was Manning’s favorite target on the night, catching 10 passes for 142 yards. Beckham added 5 catches for 54 yards and 2 touchdowns. The Giants’ ground game struggled, however, averaging only 2.8 yards per carry.</p>
<p>The Eagles’ offense was led by quarterback Carson Wentz, who completed 33 of 46 passes for 333 yards and 2 touchdowns. Tight end Zach Ertz was his favorite target, catching 15 passes for 139 yards. The Eagles’ ground game also struggled, averaging only 3.3 yards per carry.</p>
<p>The Giants got off to a strong start, scoring 14 points in the first quarter. However, the Eagles managed to tie the game at 17-17 by halftime. The third quarter was scoreless, but the Giants took back the lead in the fourth quarter with 10 points. The Eagles made a last-minute comeback attempt, but ultimately failed.</p>
<p>This was an important win for the Giants, who are now in first place in their division with a record of 4-2. The Eagles fall to 3-3 with the loss.</p>
<h1 id="Giants-Continue-to-Fall-Short-in-Close-Games"><a href="#Giants-Continue-to-Fall-Short-in-Close-Games" class="headerlink" title="Giants Continue to Fall Short in Close Games"></a>Giants Continue to Fall Short in Close Games</h1><p>The New York Giants have now fallen to 1-7 in close games this season, with their latest loss coming against the Washington Redskins. The Giants have lost by 7 points or less in 5 of their 8 games this season, and they continue to come up short in these close contests.</p>
<p>Some of the Giants’ struggles in close games can be blamed on their poor offensive line play. The offensive line has allowed 27 sacks this season, which is the 2nd worst total in the NFL. This has made it difficult for Eli Manning to get the ball downfield, and it has also led to a lot of sacks and pressure on Manning.</p>
<p>The Giants’ defense has also played a role in their close game losses. The defense has allowed an average of 30 points per game in their 7 losses, and they have blown several fourth quarter leads. The defense will need to play better if the Giants want to win more close games down the stretch.</p>
<p>There are still some positives that can be taken away from the Giants’ 1-7 record in close games. They have shown some resilience by coming back to win a few games after being down late, and they have also had some unlucky bounces go against them. If the Giants can fix some of their deficiencies on offense and defense, they could start winning more close games down the stretch.</p>
