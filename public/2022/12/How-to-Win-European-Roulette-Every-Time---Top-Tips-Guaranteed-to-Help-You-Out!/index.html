Our top tips below are guaranteed to help you out, so read on and start winning today!</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose European Roulette over other variants</li>
</ol>
<p>When playing roulette, it’s important to choose a variant that gives you the best odds of winning. European Roulette offers the best odds of all the variants available, so it’s definitely worth playing this version if you want to maximise your chances of success.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Bet on single numbers</li>
</ol>
<p>Another great tip for winning at European Roulette is to bet on single numbers. This may seem like a risky strategy, but if you do your research and pick the right numbers, you can significantly increase your chances of winning.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Place outside bets for better coverage</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition to betting on single numbers, another good strategy is to place outside bets. This will give you better coverage of the table and increase your chances of winning overall.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Win-at-European-Roulette-Proven-Strategies-for-guaranteed-success"><a href="#How-to-Win-at-European-Roulette-Proven-Strategies-for-guaranteed-success" class="headerlink" title="How to Win at European Roulette - Proven Strategies for guaranteed success!"></a>How to Win at European Roulette - Proven Strategies for guaranteed success!</h1><p>As with most casino games, roulette comes with its fair share of myths and legends. But the truth is that there are a number of strategies you can use to improve your chances of winning when playing roulette at a European casino. In this article we’ll take a look at some of the most popular and effective of these strategies, so you can put them into practice the next time you hit the casino floor.</p>
<p>The first strategy we’ll look at is known as the Martingale system. This strategy is based on doubling your bet every time you lose a hand, with the aim of recouping your losses and making a profit in the process. While it may not seem like the smartest strategy in the world, it does have the advantage of ensuring that you never lose more money than you’re prepared to lose, and it also has a very low risk of bankruptcy.</p>
<p>A variation on the Martingale system that can be even more effective is the reverse Martingale system. With this strategy, you decrease your bet size when you win instead of increasing it like in the standard Martingale system. This helps to ensure that your overall profits are maximized, while still keeping your risk relatively low.</p>
<p>Another popular strategy for playing European roulette is known as The D’Alembert System. This system is based on betting an equal amount on each spin, regardless of whether or not you win or lose previous bets. While this strategy may not seem too exciting, it does have two main advantages: firstly, it’s one of the simplest strategies to follow; secondly, it has a very low risk of ruin, making it a good option for anyone looking for a safe and steady way to play roulette.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for an even more exciting strategy to try out when playing European roulette, then why not give Roulette Corner betting a go? This strategy involves betting on two adjacent numbers on the wheel instead of just one. By doing this, you’re effectively hedging your bets and decreasing your chances of losing money overall. And because there are so many different ways to bet on two numbers at once, there’s plenty of opportunities to win big payouts with this strategy!</p>
<h1 id="How-to-ALWAYS-win-at-European-Roulette-The-ultimate-guide-to-domination"><a href="#How-to-ALWAYS-win-at-European-Roulette-The-ultimate-guide-to-domination" class="headerlink" title="How to ALWAYS win at European Roulette - The ultimate guide to domination!"></a>How to ALWAYS win at European Roulette - The ultimate guide to domination!</h1><p><em>You’re in a casino, sitting at the European Roulette table. You’ve been watching the game and studying the patterns of the ball. You feel confident and ready to take down the house.</em></p>
<p><em>First, let’s take a look at the different types of bets you can make:</em></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Straight up bet - betting on a single number, pays out 35:1.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Split bet - betting on two adjacent numbers, pays out 17:1.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Street bet - betting on three consecutive numbers, pays out 11:1.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Corner bet - betting on four adjacent numbers, pays out 8:1.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Six Line bet - betting on six adjacent numbers, pays out 5:1.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Column bet - betting on all 12 numbers in any of the three columns on the board, pays out 2:1.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Dozen bet - betting on 12 consecutive numbers (1-12, 13-24 or 25-36), pays out 2:1.</p>
</li>
</ol>

Look no further – we’ve got all the insider tips and tricks you need to know.</p>
<p>First things first: forget everything you think you know about roulette and European Roulette in particular. The house edge on this game is just 2.7%, so if your strategy is based on chance or intuition, you’re going to lose in the long run.</p>
<p>Instead, focus on using proven mathematical strategies that allow you to minimise the house edge and give yourself a better chance of winning. We’ll outline three of our favourites below.</p>
<ol>
<li>The Martingale System</li>
</ol>
<p>The Martingale system is one of the most popular roulette strategies out there, and for good reason – it’s simple to use and has a very high success rate. Here’s how it works:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Begin by placing a bet of 1 unit on any even money bet (e.g. black or red).</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you lose, double your next bet to 2 units.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you lose again, double your next bet to 4 units.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you lose for the third time in a row, double your next bet to 8 units.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you win at any point, start again at 1 unit.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This system is designed to recover any losses incurred in previous bets, and with a bit of luck, will eventually result in a profit. It’s important to note though that while the Martingale system does have a high success rate, it can also lead to huge losses if things go wrong – so be sure to set yourself a limit before starting out!</p>
<pre><code>   2) The James Bond Strategy
</code></pre>
<p>If the Martingale system seems like too much of a risk for you, then why not try the James Bond strategy instead? This is another simple system that can help you minimise the house edge on European Roulette. Here’s how it works: - Bet on red or black (or even&#x2F;odd depending on your preference). - If you win, keep betting on red or black until you lose; if you lose, start again at 1 unit.. This system is less risky than Martingale as it doesn’t involve doubling your bets every time – but don’t get complacent, as over time this strategy will still see losses accumulate. 3) The Fibonacci Strategy</p>
<p>Last but not least, we have the Fibonacci strategy – another tried and tested method for winning at European Roulette. This approach is based on mathematics rather than chance or intuition, making it one of the more reliable strategies out there. Here’s how it works: - Begin by betting 1 unit on any even money bet (e.g black or red). - If you win, add the amount of your winnings to your original stake (so now you are betting 2 units). - If you lose, subtract the amount of your loss from your original stake (now you are betting 1 unit). - Keep repeating this process until either you reach zero or hit a winner. Like the other two systems we’ve outlined above, Fibonacci can be risky if played incorrectly – but if used correctly it can help reduce losses over time and give yourself a better chance of coming out ahead when playing European Roulette</p>

However, there are a few secrets that can help you beat the house and make some money!</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The first thing to do is to understand the different types of bets that you can place in Roulette. There are inside and outside bets, and each one has its own odds. The safest bet is the black&#x2F;red bet, as it has a 50% chance of winning. However, other bets offer better odds but come with a higher risk.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In order to increase your chances of winning, you should avoid betting on single numbers. The odds of winning are only 1 in 37, so your chances of losing are high. Instead, try betting on groups of numbers or on odd&#x2F;even combinations. This will increase your chances of winning without making too much of a risk.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Another key tip is to wait for favourable roulette spins. Not all spins are created equal - some have more advantageous odds than others. When the wheel is spinning, keep an eye out for number clusters and place your bets accordingly.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Finally, always remember to gamble responsibly! Roulette is a game of chance and it’s important not to bet too much money that you can’t afford to lose. Stay in control and enjoy the thrill of the game!</p>
</li>
