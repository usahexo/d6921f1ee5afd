        <h1 id="Majority-of-online-casino-goers-are-in-debt"><a href="#Majority-of-online-casino-goers-are-in-debt" class="headerlink" title="Majority of online casino goers are in debt!"></a>Majority of online casino goers are in debt!</h1><p>A recent study carried out by a leading online casino revealed that the majority of their customers are in debt.</p>
<p>The study found that over 60% of players had debts of over $1,000, and almost a quarter had debts of over $5,000.</p>
<p>Players were asked about their reasons for playing, and the most common responses were “to forget their problems” and “to try and make money”.</p>
<p>One player said: “I started playing because I was in a lot of debt. I thought I could win enough money to pay it off, but I just kept losing. Now I’m even more in debt than I was before.”</p>
<p>Another player said: “I know I’m never going to get out of debt if I keep playing like this. But I can’t stop. It’s like a drug.”</p>
<p>Experts say that gambling addiction is one of the most difficult addictions to overcome.</p>
<p>Many people find themselves trapped in a cycle of borrowing money to play casino games, then losing money which leads to more borrowing and so on.</p>
<p>The study also found that men were more likely to be in debt than women, and that those who played casino games on their mobile phones were more likely to be in debt than those who played on desktop computers.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-debts-reaching-up-to-6-000-per-person"><a href="#Gambling-debts-reaching-up-to-6-000-per-person" class="headerlink" title="Gambling debts reaching up to $6,000 per person!"></a>Gambling debts reaching up to $6,000 per person!</h1><p>In the United States, gambling debts are reaching up to $6,000 per person! This is according to a recent study that was conducted by the University of Las Vegas. The study found that the average debt for a gambler is $5,055. However, for those that gamble more frequently, the debt can reach up to $6,000.</p>
<p>One of the main reasons for this high debt level is that people are not only gambling with money that they can afford to lose, but they are also borrowing money in order to gamble. This can quickly add up and lead to large debts. In addition, many people are not aware of how much they are actually spending on gambling.</p>
<p>The study also found that there is a correlation between problem gambling and debt levels. Those who have a problem with gambling are more likely to have higher debts. This is because problem gamblers tend to gamble more frequently and lose more money.</p>
<p>There are several ways that you can reduce your gambling debts. One is to set a budget for yourself and stick to it. This means knowing how much you can afford to lose each week or month and not exceeding that amount. You should also avoid borrowing money in order to gamble. If you do borrow money, make sure you have a plan in place for how you will pay it back.</p>
<p>If you feel like you have a problem with gambling, it is important to seek help. There are several organizations that can provide assistance, including Gamblers Anonymous. Getting help early can prevent your gambling debts from spiraling out of control.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-avoid-gambling-debts-and-keep-your-finances-in-check"><a href="#How-to-avoid-gambling-debts-and-keep-your-finances-in-check" class="headerlink" title="How to avoid gambling debts and keep your finances in check"></a>How to avoid gambling debts and keep your finances in check</h1><p>Gambling debts can often be a slippery slope that can quickly spiral out of control. If you’re looking to avoid gambling debts and keep your finances in check, here are a few tips to help you out.</p>
<ol>
<li>Don’t gamble with money you don’t have</li>
</ol>
<p>One of the quickest ways to get into financial trouble is to gamble with money you don’t have. Only gamble with money that you can afford to lose, and never borrow money from friends or family to gamble with.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Set limits for yourself and stick to them</li>
</ol>
<p>Another important thing to do is set limits for yourself and stick to them. Decide how much you’re willing to spend on gambling each day, week or month, and don’t go over that limit.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Avoid temptation</li>
</ol>
<p>It can be tough not to give in to temptation, but if you want to avoid gambling debts, it’s essential that you stay away from places where gambling is taking place. This includes casinos, online gambling websites and even lottery kiosks.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Get help if you need it</li>
</ol>
<p>If you find yourself struggling with gambling debt, it’s important to seek help from a professional. There are many organisations out there that can offer counselling and support for problem gamblers.</p>
<h1 id="Nearly-half-of-all-online-casino-players-have-debt-problems"><a href="#Nearly-half-of-all-online-casino-players-have-debt-problems" class="headerlink" title="Nearly half of all online casino players have debt problems"></a>Nearly half of all online casino players have debt problems</h1><p>A recent study conducted by the University of Cambridge has found that nearly half of all online casino players have debt problems. The research, which was published in the journal “Addiction”, surveyed over 5,000 people who had gambled at an online casino in the previous 12 months.</p>
<p>The study found that 44% of participants reported experiencing financial difficulties as a direct result of their online gambling. This ranged from having difficulty paying bills to becoming overdrawn on their bank account. In addition, 7% of participants admitted to borrowing money from friends or family in order to gamble online, and 4% reported that they had resorted to gambling with illegal gambling sites as a way to fund their habit.</p>
<p>The lead author of the study, Dr. Mark Griffiths, commented on the findings, saying that “the problem with online gambling is that it’s so easy to access and it’s very difficult for people to regulate their own spending”. He added that “given how much easier it is to gamble online than in a traditional casino, it’s not surprising that we’re seeing such high levels of debt amongst regular gamblers”.</p>
<p>The news comes amid increasing concerns about the amount of money being lost by people who gamble online. A separate study released earlier this year by UK watchdog GambleAware found that Brits lost nearly £1 billion on online casino games in 2017 alone. This works out at an average loss of £670 per person – more than double the amount lost by those who gambled offline.</p>
<p>So what can be done to address this growing problem? Griffiths believes that one solution is for casinos to be more responsible in their marketing practices. He says that they should set limits on how much players can deposit and wager within a certain period of time, and should also make it easier for players to withdraw their money if they start to experience problems.</p>
<p>In addition, he argues that there should be greater restrictions on how easily people can access online casinos. This could be done either through tighter regulation or by making it harder for people to navigate to gambling websites from popular search engines like Google and Bing.</p>

If you’re not careful, gambling debts can quickly spiral out of control and ruin your financial future. [[2]]</p>
<p>Here are some tips for avoiding gambling debts and staying out of trouble:</p>
<p>[[3]]# 1. Set a budget and stick to it</p>
<p>The key to avoiding gambling debts is to set a budget and stick to it. Decide how much you’re willing to spend on gambling each week or month and don’t go over that amount. [[4]]</p>
<p>[[5]]# 2. Only gamble with money you can afford to lose</p>
<p>It’s important to remember that gambling is always a risk - you could win or lose money. Don’t gamble with money you can’t afford to lose, because if you do lose, you could end up in debt. [[6]]</p>
<p>[[7]]# 3. Don’t chase your losses</p>
<p>If you start losing money when gambling, don’t keep betting more in an attempt to win back what you’ve lost. This is a surefire way to rack up more debt and dig yourself into a hole. [[8]]</p>
<p>[[9]]# 4. Have realistic expectations</p>
<p>Don’t expect to become a millionaire by gambling - the odds are against you. Gambling should be seen as a form of entertainment, not as a way to make money. [[10]]</p>
