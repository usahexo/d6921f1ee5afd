Here are the 10 greatest championships in sports:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Indianapolis 500</li>
</ol>
<p>Since its inception in 1911, the Indianapolis 500 has consistently been one of the most prestigious auto races in the world. With over 100 years of history, it’s no surprise that this race is often considered one of the greatest championships in all of sports.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>The Boston Marathon</li>
</ol>
<p>The Boston Marathon is a long-standing and iconic running event that takes place each year in Boston, Massachusetts. First held in 1897, the Boston Marathon is now one of the most famous races in the world and is often considered one of the greatest championships in running.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>The Tour de France</li>
</ol>
<p>The Tour de France is a prestigious cycling race that has been held annually since 1903. Considered one of the most challenging bike races in the world, the Tour de France is also one of the most celebrated championships in all of sports.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>The Kentucky Derby</li>
</ol>
<p>The Kentucky Derby is an annual horse race that takes place at Churchill Downs racetrack in Louisville, Kentucky. First run in 1875, the Kentucky Derby is now one of the most well-known and highly respected horse races in America and around the world.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>The Super Bowl</li>
</ol>
<p>The Super Bowl is without a doubt the biggest and most important event in American football. Inaugurated as part of the 1966 season, the Super Bowl has since become an annual tradition and one ofthe most watched sporting events on television each year. With so much attention and hype surrounding it, it’s easy to see why many consider it to be one ofthe greatest championships in all of sports.</p>

<h1 id="Why-are-they-the-10-Greatest-Championships-in-Sports"><a href="#Why-are-they-the-10-Greatest-Championships-in-Sports" class="headerlink" title="Why are they the 10 Greatest Championships in Sports?"></a>Why are they the 10 Greatest Championships in Sports?</h1><p>The 10 greatest championships in sports are the ones that, for one reason or another, have made a lasting impression on the fans and participants. Some championships are more memorable than others because of the drama that unfolded, the athletes who competed, or the way the game was won. Here is a look at 10 of the greatest championships in sports history.</p>
<p>#10 The 2011 World Series</p>
<p>The 2011 World Series between the St. Louis Cardinals and Texas Rangers is often remembered for the dramatic comeback by the Cardinals. Down to their last strike in Game 6, St. Louis rallied to win the game and then went on to win Game 7 to capture the championship. This series was also memorable for Cardinal catcher Yadier Molina, who was named MVP after batting .333 with two home runs and six RBIs.</p>
<p>#9 The 1976 Montreal Olympics</p>
<p>The 1976 Montreal Olympics were a watershed moment for American athletics. The United States had been shut out of gold medals at the previous two Olympics, but they came roaring back in Montreal with a record haul of 96 medals, including 44 golds. This included spectacular performances by swimmer Shirley Babashoff (four gold medals) and track stars Bruce Jenner (gold medal in decathlon) and Carl Lewis (four gold medals).</p>
<p>#8 The 2004 Boston Red Sox</p>
<p>The 2004 Boston Red Sox will always be remembered for their dramatic comeback against the New York Yankees in the ALCS. Trailing 3-0 in games, Boston rallied to win four straight games and advance to the World Series. There they faced off against their arch-rivals, the St. Louis Cardinals. After falling behind 3-0 in games, Boston again staged a comeback, winning Games 4-5-6 to bring home their first championship since 1918.</p>
<p>#7 The 1980 U.S. Men’s Hockey Team</p>
<p>Few sporting events can match the drama of the 1980 U.S. Men’s Hockey Team’s victory over Finland in Lake Placid to earn America’s first gold medal in Olympic hockey. This improbable victory – which came after America had been knocked out of competition earlier in the tournament – has become enshrined in American sporting lore and is still celebrated today.</p>
<p>#6 The 1971 Pittsburgh Steelers</p>
<p>The 1971 Pittsburgh Steelers are remembered as one of NFL’s all-time great teams. Led by legendary head coach Chuck Noll, this team dominated opponents on their way to an unprecedented four Super Bowl victories in six years (1974, 1975, 1978, 1979). This dynasty is still considered one of football’s most revered teams ever assembled.</p>
<h1 id="How-were-they-chosen"><a href="#How-were-they-chosen" class="headerlink" title="How were they chosen?"></a>How were they chosen?</h1><p>The candidates who were nominated to the Supreme Court were chosen by the President of the United States after much consideration. The President looks at a candidate’s qualifications, experience, and character when making his decision. He also takes into account the needs of the country when making his selection.</p>
<p>The President nominates candidates for the Supreme Court and then they must be approved by the Senate. The Senate is made up of 100 members, each state has two senators. To be approved, a nominee must receive a majority vote from the Senate.</p>
<p>Since a justice on the Supreme Court can serve for life, it is a very important decision to make. The President wants to make sure that he is nominating someone who is qualified and will serve the country well.</p>
<h1 id="What-do-the-rankings-mean"><a href="#What-do-the-rankings-mean" class="headerlink" title="What do the rankings mean?"></a>What do the rankings mean?</h1><p>The world of college athletics is a frequently confusing one. Between dozens of conferences and tournaments, it can be difficult to make heads or tails of which teams are the best in the country. That’s where the rankings come in - but what do they actually mean?</p>
<p>There are a variety of different ranking systems, but most of them boil down to a simple formula: wins and losses, with some additional weight given to quality opponents. The most popular system is the College Football Playoff Rankings, which are released by the NCAA every Tuesday.</p>
<p>The top 25 teams in the CFP Rankings are generally considered to be some of the best in the country. However, there’s no exact way to measure who is better than whom - after all, there are over 1,000 schools playing Division I football. As a result, these rankings are often debated and questioned.</p>
<p>One thing is for sure, though: getting a high ranking is important for college football teams. It can help with recruiting, postseason positioning, and even selling tickets. So while the rankings may not be perfect, they still hold a lot of weight in the world of college athletics.</p>
<h1 id="Who-disagrees-with-the-rankings"><a href="#Who-disagrees-with-the-rankings" class="headerlink" title="Who disagrees with the rankings?"></a>Who disagrees with the rankings?</h1><p>In the world of college sports, there is a common belief that if you’re not one of the top schools in the country, then you’re essentially worthless. While there are some programs out there who boast rich traditions and consistent success, they are often overshadowed by schools who consistently rank higher in the major polls.</p>
<p>But who decides these rankings? Who gets to say which schools are the best in the country? And more importantly, who is disagreeing with them?</p>
<p>The answer to all of these questions is, unsurprisingly, a group of people known as the NCAA. The NCAA is an organization made up of universities from all over the country who come together to create rules and regulations for collegiate athletics. One of their most important functions is to rank colleges and universities based on their athletic performance.</p>
<p>This system has been met with criticism over the years, as many feel that it does a disservice to smaller schools who may not have access to the same resources as their larger counterparts. As a result, many teams from so-called “mid-major” conferences often struggle when they find themselves up against teams from power conferences in postseason play.</p>
<p>This disparity was on full display during this year’s NCAA tournament, where perennial powerhouse Gonzaga was upset by underdog Xavier in the Round of 32. This came as a surprise to many pundits, as Xavier is a member of one of the so-called “mid-major” conferences (the Big East). Gonzaga, on the other hand, competes in the much more difficult West Coast Conference.</p>
<p>So what does this mean for college sports going forward? Will we continue to see upsets like this happen more often as teams from power conferences face off against squads from mid-major conferences? Only time will tell. But one thing is for sure: The NCAA’s ranking system is far from perfect, and always open to criticism.</p>
