#  Philadelphia's First Live Casino Opens Friday!

Philadelphia's first live casino will open its doors to the public this Friday, December 1st. The casino, which is said to be the most technologically advanced in the state, has already been generating a lot of buzz in the city.

The new casino is located just south of the city in Chester, Pennsylvania and will offer both slots and table games. It will also have a variety of restaurants and bars, as well as a luxury hotel.

The casino has been in development for years and is expected to create over 1,000 jobs in the region. It has also been estimated that it will generate over $100 million in tax revenue for the state each year.

Officials from the casino say that they are ready for launch and are excited to bring this new amenity to the city. They expect that the casino will be a major draw not only for Philadelphia residents, but also for those living in nearby states.
