#  What Casino Winnings Include To Be Filed In NYC

Revenue earned from casinos in the Big Apple totaled around $2.5 billion in 2018. According to recently released figures, at least $1.16 billion of casino winnings were paid out to winners during the year. That’s a lot of money changing hands, and these days all of it needs to be reported to the taxman.

Casino winnings are considered taxable income in New York State, and that goes for both resident and nonresident players. The good news is that there are a few deductions and exclusions you can claim on your tax return to help reduce your tax bill.

In order to file your casino winnings with the IRS, you’ll need to have your W-2G form handy. This form is issued by the casino and reports the amount of your winnings as well as the amount withheld for taxes. You should receive a W-2G for any winning session that pays out more than $600 in net profit.

If you don’t receive a W-2G form, or if you have any questions about what needs to be included on your return, please contact us for assistance.

#  Everything You Need To Know About Filing Your Casino Winnings In NYC

In order to legally file your casino winnings with the New York City tax bureau, you must be a resident of the city. Nonresidents are subject to a higher tax rate. In addition, you must file an information return with the IRS reporting your gambling income and deducting your gambling losses.

The first step is to determine the amount of your winnings that are taxable. Winnings from slot machines, video poker, and bingo are all taxable. Winnings from blackjack, craps, and roulette are only taxable if they are net winnings after deducting losses. For example, if you have a net profit of $1,000 from blackjack but lose $500 playing roulette, only the profit of $500 is taxable.

Your total casino winnings for the year should be included on line 21 of your Form 1040 as other income. You can then use Schedule A to deduct your gambling losses up to the amount of your winnings. If you have more losses than winnings, you cannot deduct the entire loss on Schedule A. The excess can be carried forward to future years until it is used up.

It is important to keep good records of your gambling activity so that you can accurately report your winnings and losses on your tax return. Records should include the date and amount of each wager, as well as your wins and losses.

What constitutes a “trade or business” is not always black and white, and can be determined on a case-by-case basis. In general, however, if you are making a profit from gambling then it is likely that the winnings are considered taxable.

If you are unsure whether your casino winnings are taxable in NYC, it is best to speak with an accountant or tax attorney to get specific advice for your situation. Despite the somewhat confusing rules around gambling and taxes, it is important to report any casino winnings on your tax return. Not doing so can result in fines and penalties from the IRS.
