        <h1 id="Australian-painter-Geoffrey-Heysen’s-stop-game-hailed-as-breakthrough-in-abstract-art"><a href="#Australian-painter-Geoffrey-Heysen’s-stop-game-hailed-as-breakthrough-in-abstract-art" class="headerlink" title="Australian painter Geoffrey Heysen’s stop game hailed as breakthrough in abstract art"></a>Australian painter Geoffrey Heysen’s stop game hailed as breakthrough in abstract art</h1><p>When Geoffrey Heysen stopped painting in the late 1950s, art critics credited him with finding a new way to approach abstract art.</p>
<p>Born in Adelaide, Heysen was one of Australia’s most successful artists. After studying at the Royal Academy of Art in London, he returned to Adelaide to teach at the South Australian School of Art. In the early 1940s, he began experimenting with abstract painting, and his work soon gained acclaim both in Australia and overseas.</p>
<p>In the 1950s, Heysen’s paintings became increasingly minimalist, with simple geometric shapes and pure colours. In a 1958 article for Artforum magazine, critic Clement Greenberg described Heysen as “one of the very few painters who has arrived at an absolutely personal style.”</p>
<p>Heysen’s stop game was a radical departure from traditional Abstract Expressionism, and it has been credited with paving the way for later movements such as Minimalism and Pop art. His paintings are now considered some of the most important examples of Australian abstract art.</p>
<h1 id="Heysen’s-stop-game-up-for-auction-expected-to-fetch-1-5-million"><a href="#Heysen’s-stop-game-up-for-auction-expected-to-fetch-1-5-million" class="headerlink" title="Heysen’s stop game up for auction, expected to fetch $1.5 million"></a>Heysen’s stop game up for auction, expected to fetch $1.5 million</h1><p>Renowned artist Hans Heysen’s “The stop game” is up for auction at Sotheby’s with an estimated price of $1.5 million.</p>
<p>Heysen (1877-1968) was a prolific painter and one of Australia’s most celebrated artists. “The stop game”, completed in 1937, is one of his most recognised works and is considered to be a masterpiece of Australian art.</p>
<p>The painting measures 153 x 228 cm and is composed of 17 oil on canvas panels. It was last sold in 1984 for $360,000.</p>
<p>“The stop game” portrays two teams of men playing a spirited game of football in the Adelaide Hills. Heysen has skillfully captured the action and energy of the game, as well as the unique landscape of his home state.</p>
<p>This painting is highly sought after by collectors both in Australia and overseas, and is expected to sell for a record price at auction.</p>
<h1 id="Heysen’s-daughter-defends-father’s-legacy-criticizes-modern-art"><a href="#Heysen’s-daughter-defends-father’s-legacy-criticizes-modern-art" class="headerlink" title="Heysen’s daughter defends father’s legacy, criticizes modern art"></a>Heysen’s daughter defends father’s legacy, criticizes modern art</h1><p>In a scathing new essay, Heidi Heysen — daughter of the famed Australian artist Sir Hans Heysen — has taken aim at the modern art world, accusing it of being “pretentious” and “lacking in soul.”</p>
<p>Heidi Heysen says that while her father’s art is “timeless,” much of today’s art is “just noise.”</p>
<p>“My father always strived to create something beautiful and enduring, whereas so much of today’s art is just a passing fad,” she writes. “It saddens me that so many people are fooled by all the clever marketing and hype.”</p>
<p>Heidi Heysen also defends her father’s legacy, saying that he was never motivated by money or fame.</p>
<p>“He was a true artist who created for the love of it,” she writes. “I think that’s why his work still resonates with people today.”</p>
<h1 id="Controversial-new-exhibit-features-Heysen’s-stop-game-alongside-works-by-Picasso-and-Matisse"><a href="#Controversial-new-exhibit-features-Heysen’s-stop-game-alongside-works-by-Picasso-and-Matisse" class="headerlink" title="Controversial new exhibit features Heysen’s stop game alongside works by Picasso and Matisse"></a>Controversial new exhibit features Heysen’s stop game alongside works by Picasso and Matisse</h1><p>A new exhibit at the Art Gallery of South Australia is causing a stir, with Heysen’s stop game being displayed alongside works by Picasso and Matisse.</p>
<p>The stop game was painted by Hans Heysen in 1912 and is one of the artist’s most significant works. It is an oil painting on canvas that measures 200 x 290 cm, and is currently owned by the Art Gallery of South Australia.</p>
<p>The stop game has been controversial since it was created, with some people claiming that it is a plagiarized work. However, others argue that Heysen was simply inspired by the work of Picasso and Matisse and that he should be given credit for his own original work.</p>
<p>The new exhibit at the Art Gallery of South Australia will allow visitors to decide for themselves who created the stop game. It will be accompanied by a range of other works from Heysen, Picasso, and Matisse, so that people can compare and contrast their styles.</p>
<h1 id="Heysen’s-stop-game-the-painting-that-divided-a-nation"><a href="#Heysen’s-stop-game-the-painting-that-divided-a-nation" class="headerlink" title="Heysen’s stop game: the painting that divided a nation"></a>Heysen’s stop game: the painting that divided a nation</h1><p>In 1928, a painting by Hans Heysen caused a stir in the art world. Entitled “Heysen’s Stop Game”, it depicted two kangaroos fighting in the Australian bush. While some viewers saw it as a beautiful example of nature in action, others criticised Heysen for exploiting the animals for his own gain. The controversy split the nation, with newspapers and art critics taking sides on either side of the debate.</p>
<p>To Heysen, the painting was about “the eternal strife between Life and Death, which is ever going on around us”. He believed that humans could learn a lot from observing nature’s continual cycle of birth, growth, decay and rebirth. In response to his critics, he said: “I paint what I see around me and if people do not like it they can go to hell.”</p>
<p>Despite the heated debate, “Heysen’s Stop Game” is now recognised as a masterpiece of Australian landscape painting. It is held in the National Gallery of Australia in Canberra and is one of the most popular exhibits in the gallery’s collection.</p>
