#  What is the English League Championship?

The English League Championship is a professional football league in England and the second-highest tier of the English football league system. The league consists of 24 teams, and operates on a system of promotion and relegation with the Football League.

The Football League Championship was founded in 2004 as the first new top flight division in English football since the Premier League was formed in 1992. The English Association Football League – which operated the first nationwide football league championship in England – was founded in 1888, and originally consisted of 12 member clubs.

# Championship clubs

Clubs relegated from the Premier League are usually joined by three clubs promoted from Football League One (the third tier of English football), but two other clubs are also promoted to make up the 24 teams. The current champions are Wolverhampton Wanderers who were promoted as champions from League One in 2017–18.

# How it works

The Football League Championship operates on a system of promotion and relegation with the Football League. At the end of each season, the bottom three clubs are relegated to Football League One, and the top two clubs from that division are promoted to the Championship. The third-placed club enters a play-off with the fourth-placed club from League One, with the winner gaining admittance to the Championship.
