#  What is Party Night?

Party Night is an event that celebrates a release of a new product, game, or movie. It is usually hosted by the company who created the product. The event is invite-only and includes celebrities, journalists, and consumers who have been selected to attend. Party Night usually takes place in a large venue with food, drinks, and entertainment.

The first Party Night took place in 1994 for the release of Windows 95. Microsoft rented out the Hollywood Palladium and invited 5,000 guests. Since then, party nights have become increasingly popular with companies spending millions of dollars on elaborate events. In 2012, Microsoft spent $8 million on their Party Night for the launch of Windows 8.

Some Party Nights are more extravagant than others. Samsung's 2015 party for the launch of the Galaxy S6 was held at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. The party featured performances by Rihanna and Kanye West and was attended by over 3,000 people.

Whether you're a celebrity or just a regular Joe, it's always exciting to be invited to a Party Night. If you're lucky enough to be invited to one, be sure to have your camera ready!
