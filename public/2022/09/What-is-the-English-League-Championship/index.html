The league consists of 24 teams, and operates on a system of promotion and relegation with the Football League.</p>
<p>The Football League Championship was founded in 2004 as the first new top flight division in English football since the Premier League was formed in 1992. The English Association Football League – which operated the first nationwide football league championship in England – was founded in 1888, and originally consisted of 12 member clubs.</p>
<h1 id="Championship-clubs"><a href="#Championship-clubs" class="headerlink" title="Championship clubs"></a>Championship clubs</h1><p>Clubs relegated from the Premier League are usually joined by three clubs promoted from Football League One (the third tier of English football), but two other clubs are also promoted to make up the 24 teams. The current champions are Wolverhampton Wanderers who were promoted as champions from League One in 2017–18.</p>
<h1 id="How-it-works"><a href="#How-it-works" class="headerlink" title="How it works"></a>How it works</h1><p>The Football League Championship operates on a system of promotion and relegation with the Football League. At the end of each season, the bottom three clubs are relegated to Football League One, and the top two clubs from that division are promoted to the Championship. The third-placed club enters a play-off with the fourth-placed club from League One, with the winner gaining admittance to the Championship.</p>

It was founded in 1888 as the Football League and is the second-oldest professional football league in the world. The league operates on a system of promotion and relegation with the English Premier League.</p>
<p>Thirteen clubs competed in the inaugural season. Preston North End were crowned champions after finishing the season with an unbeaten record. The following year, Aston Villa won their first championship.</p>
<p>The current champions are Wolverhampton Wanderers, who finished first in the 2017–18 season. They earned promotion to the Premier League and replaced Brighton &amp; Hove Albion who were promoted to the top flight of English football after winning the 2017–18 FA Cup.</p>
<p>The Championship is contested by 24 teams, 21 of which are from England and 3 from Wales. The teams are divided into two divisions: the Championship and League One. Each division has 12 teams. The two lowest-placed teams in each division are relegated to League One, and the top two teams from League One are promoted to the Championship.</p>
