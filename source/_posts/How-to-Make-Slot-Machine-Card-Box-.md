#  How to Make Slot Machine Card Box 

 Slot machine is a very interesting game. If you like playing this game, you may also want to make your own slot machine at home. In this article, we are going to show you how to make a slot machine card box.

What you need:

– A printer
– A paper cutter
– Scissors
– A glue stick
– Ruler
– Pencil

Instructions:
1. Cut a piece of cardboard into a 6″x9″ rectangle. 
2. On the longest side, fold the cardboard in half so that it is now 6″x4-1/2″ 
3. Now cut 1/2″ from the folded edge all the way across (this will create the curved top of the slot machine). 
4. Next, score (lightly draw lines) down the length of the folded edge at 1/2″ intervals (we scored ours every 1/2″ but you could do every 3/4″ or 1″ if you’d like). After scoring, fold all of the lines inward so that they crease properly.



























  5. Open up the card and use a ruler to draw a line in the center of the short end (this will be where we make our cuts). Now cut along this line on both sides (again, be sure to leave about 1/4″ uncut in the center). This will create our card slots. 
6. Finally, use your glue stick to attach the curved top to the bottom of your card box (be sure that it is centered). Allow it to dry completely before using.

In this article, we will show you how to make a card slot in a slot machine.

First, you need to cut a piece of cardboard that is 5 1/2 inches wide and 9 inches long. Then, cut a slit in the center of the cardboard that is 1/4 inch wide and 2 inches long.

Next, fold the cardboard in half so that the slit is facing inward. Then, hot glue or staple the two ends of the slit together.

Finally, use a knife to cut out a notch at the top of the card slot that is 1/4 inch wide and 1/2 inch deep. This notch will hold your card in place.

Your card slot is now complete!

#  Slot machine card box how to make 

There are all sorts of different ways that you can make a card box for your slot machine cards. You can use an old CD case, or even make one out of cardboard. If you want to be really fancy, you can use a wooden box that you have on hand.

The first thing you need to do is measure the size of your card deck. You will need to make sure that your card box is big enough to hold the deck comfortably. Once you have the measurements, you can start making the box.

If you are using cardboard, it is a good idea to cut out two pieces that are the same size and then glue them together. You can then fold the top and bottom flaps inward and glue them in place. If desired, you can also add a handle to the top of your card box.

If you are using a CD case, simply cut out two pieces of cardboard that are the same size as the case. Glue them together and fold the top and bottom flaps inward. You will then need to poke a hole in each end of the case and insert some sturdy string or ribbon so that you can carry it easily.

If you are using a wooden box, it is best to measure and draw out the dimensions onto some paper before cutting any wood. Once you have your template drawn out, cut out two pieces of wood that match the dimensions. Use wood glue to attach them together and then use a drill or screwdriver to create holes in each corner for screws. This will help keep your box together more securely. You can then fold up the top and bottom flaps like with other boxes and use some strong glue or nails to keep them in place. 

No matter which method you choose, make sure that your card box is sturdy enough to protect your cards while they are not in use!

#  How to Make a Slot Machine out of cereal boxes 

Making a slot machine out of cereal boxes is easy and fun! All you need are some empty cereal boxes, scissors, glue, and tape.

To make the body of the slot machine, cut two cereal boxes in half so that they are tall and thin. Glue them together to form a tube shape. You can also tape them together if you prefer.

Next, cut three slots into one side of the tube. These will be the slot machine's "reels."

 Now it's time to decorate your slot machine! You can use stickers, markers, or any other decorations to make it look cool.

To make the "arm" that pulls the lever on a real slot machine, cut a small rectangle out of one side of the tube. Then, cut a semicircle out of the middle of the rectangle. This will be the arm. Glue or tape it in place on the top of the slot machine.

Finally, put some money in your slot machine! Simply roll some small pieces of paper into balls and put them in through the top slit. Then pull back on the arm to spin the reels!

#  How to make a slot machine card holder

Slot machines are popular among casino-goers and players. They offer an opportunity to win money or prizes while enjoying the excitement of gambling. Slot machines come in different shapes and sizes, usually taking up a large footprint in the casino. This makes it difficult to move around without hitting another machine or player. One way to circumvent this is to use a slot machine card holder.

A slot machine card holder is an attachment that can be placed on a regular playing card so that it can be used in a slot machine. The holder has two protruding arms that fit into the designated slots on either side of the machine's payment window. Once the card is in place, the player can pull down on the arms, which will activate the machine and begin play.

There are many different types of slot machine card holders on the market. Some attach with magnets, others use clips or straps, and some are even made to look like miniature slot machines. The important thing is to find one that is compatible with the type of slot machine you are using.

Making your own slot machine card holder is a quick and easy project that can be done with basic materials found at most craft stores. You will need:
One piece of sturdy cardboard (at least 9" by 12")
Two 1" pieces of Velcro® (sticky-back)
 
Paint or markers in any color(s) you like
Scissors
Cutting mat (optional) 
Ruler
Once you have gathered your supplies, follow these simple steps to make your own slot machine card holder:
1) Cut the cardboard piece into a rectangle that measures 9" by 12". If you have a cutting mat, this will help keep your cardboard from getting damaged during cutting. 
2) Measure and mark 2" from each end of the long side of your rectangle and draw a line between them. This will create four 3" squares in the center of your rectangle. 
3) Cut out the four squares you just drew. 
4) On one square, measure and mark 1" from each edge and draw a line between them. Cut out this smaller square to create a tab. This will be used later to attach the Velcro® straps. 
5) On two opposite sides of your rectangle (not including the tabs), measure and mark 1" from each edge and draw a line between them. Draw another line parallel to these lines 3/4" away from them (see image). This will create two "slots" on each side of your rectangle that will hold the arms of your card holder in place when activated. 
6) Paint or decorate your holder any way you like! You can use solid colors, patterns, or even pictures cut out from magazines or newspapers. Be creative! 
7) When dry, attach one piece of Velcro® tape to each tab on your holder . Make sure they are attached securely .  8) Attach the other pieces of Velcro® tape to each strap on your playing card . Again, make sure they are attached securely .
